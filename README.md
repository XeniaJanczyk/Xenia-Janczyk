### Hi, I'm Xenia 👋👩🏻‍💻
I am a beginner software tester with knowledge of ISTQB Foundation Level.

Thanks to courses I have completed and practice I have gained, I know
how to work in a Scrum. I know bug tracking tools such as Jira or Testlink
and also know the basics of MySQL, Postman and DevTools. What's more, thanks 
to the automation testing course I know the basics of programming language 
which is Java, framework Selenium and how to work with Github.
